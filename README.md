In order to make driving safer and prevent injuries, riders wear helmets as protective headgear. In this study, a smart helmet is created that can detect a rider's fall and send an alert via a GSM module, coupled with the fall's location determined by a GPS device, to prevent delays in rescue efforts. The helmet is equipped with inertial sensors, such as gyroscope and accelerometer sensors with a three-axis sensing unit, which are controlled by an ARDUINO-based microprocessor to detect falls. In 28 experiments, the developed helmet is employed for data collection, and 22 statistical aspects are gleaned from the gathered information. Using the wrapper technique, a subset of distinguishing characteristics is chosen, and four different classifiers—Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine—are then applied to the chosen features to categories the two states, fall and non-fall. The Nave Bayes classifies rider falls with the maximum accuracy, 98.21%, as shown by the data. The suggested method beats current cutting-edge fall detection methods in terms of classification precision.
